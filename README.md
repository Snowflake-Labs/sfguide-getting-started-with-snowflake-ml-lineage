# Getting Started with Snowflake ML Lineage

## Overview

[ML Lineage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-ml/ml-lineage) provides comprehensive tracing of data as it flows through your machine learning pipeline. This feature enables you to track the lineage between various data artifacts, including source tables/views/stages, feature views, datasets, registered models, and deployed model services. Additionally, ML Lineage captures the relationships between cloned artifacts and artifacts of similar types, ensuring a complete view of data transformations and dependencies within your pipeline.

This quickstart will introduce ML Lineage by building an ML pipeline containing lineage at every step. You will see how source data, Feature Store, Datasets, and models all are connected via lineage for easy tracking.
